# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is a solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Table of contents

Overview
The challenge: Create a responsive blog preview card with a profile section, button, and description text. The card needs to display properly on mobile and desktop devices with media query support.

Screenshot:

Desktop view: The card should be centered with the profile image and name aligned next to each other.
Mobile view: The card adjusts in size, and the profile section stacks vertically for better readability.

My process
Built with:HTML CSS

HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for styling and layout
Flexbox for aligning the profile image and name
Media queries for mobile responsiveness
Web fonts from Google Fonts (SUSE font)
What I learned: During this project, I learned:

How to effectively use display: flex for layouts.
Implementing media queries to adjust card styles on mobile devices.
Styling text with font-weight, line-height, and letter-spacing for better readability.
Continued development: I want to explore more advanced CSS techniques, including CSS Grid for more complex layouts and CSS animations to enhance user experience.

Useful resources:

MDN Web Docs: Helped me understand display: flex and media queries.
Frontend Mentor: For providing the challenge and structure for improvement.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
